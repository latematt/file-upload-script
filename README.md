# PHP File Upload Script

To use this, your file structure must be something like this:

    u/
        script/
            include/
                mysql.php
            index.php
        pictures-go-here.png
        index.html (for uploading)
    index.html (for your main site if you'd like this)

This is so you can have your images in u/ and your users can link something similar to this:

    http://u.yourdomain.com/image.png
